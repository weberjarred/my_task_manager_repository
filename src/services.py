def capture_task(task_list):

    This function allows a user to capture data about a new task,
    create a Task object with the provided data, append the object to
    the given task list, and update the tasks.txt file with the new
    task information.

    This function will allow a user to capture data
    about a (new) task and use this data to create a Task object
    and append this object inside the task list,
    and updates the tasks.txt file with the new data.

    Parameters:
        task_list (list): A list to which the newly created Task object
        will be appended.

    Functionality:
        - Prompts the user to input the username of the assignee, task title,
          task description, and task due date.
        - Automatically sets the task's assigned date to the current date.
        - Sets the task completion status to "No" by default.
        - Creates a Task object with the provided and generated data.
        - Appends the Task object to the provided task_list.
        - Writes the task details to the tasks.txt file in an append mode.

    Exceptions:
        - ValueError: Raised if invalid input is provided. This ensures
          that the input adheres to the expected format or constraints.
        - Exception: Catches any other errors that occur during the task
          creation or file writing process and displays an appropriate
          error message.
